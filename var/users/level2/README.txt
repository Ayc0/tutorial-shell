Oh no, there is a compressed file which is split into 5 different chunks but the chunk "d" is missing...

To execute a file, you can do "./name_of_my_file"
If it is said "permission denied", you can do "chmod +x ./name_of_my_file" to add (+) the execution (x) permission to this file
(you can use - to remove a permission and it also works with the read (r) and write (w) permissions)

Here are the commands that might be useful:
* cd (change directory)
* ls (list)
* mv (move / rename)
* cp (copy)
* pwd (print working directory)
* chmod (change mode / permissions)
