Oh it looks like you're trapped inside a weird folder.

Here are the commands that might be useful:
* cd (change / move to another directory)
* ls (list: show content of a folder)
* mv (move / rename)
* cat (show file)
* less (show file and can scroll in it)
* cp (copy)
* rm (remove)
* pwd (print working directory)
