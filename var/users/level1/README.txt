Finally!

But I think I missed something on my way back.

Hint: you can add parameters to command.
For instance:
* "ls (dir)" shows the files in the current directory or in the directory "dir",
* "ls -l (dir)" shows the files with their size and permissions,
* "ls -a (dir)" shows the files plus the hidden files
* "ls -la (dir)" = "ls -l -a (dir)" shows files and hidden files with permissions, and size.
